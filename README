Cachable Model
==============

This plugin caches single record primary key based database lookups for ActiveRecord models.
It is similar to the CachedModel plugin but uses the Rails.cache object available in newer
versions of Rails (2.1 or later).

Example
=======

class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
	cachable_model
end
