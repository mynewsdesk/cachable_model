Cachable Model
==============

This plugin caches single record primary key based database lookups for ActiveRecord models.
It is similar to the CachedModel plugin but uses the Rails.cache object available in newer
versions of Rails (2.1 or later). The plugin also makes it possible to cache lookups by other
columns than the primary key.

Limitations
=======

Due to difficulties in SQL parsing the :find_by option only works for columns with data without
spaces. The option is intended for unique non-numeric columns such as usernames, emails etc.

Example
=======

class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
	cachable_model # This will cache id lookups only
end

class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
	cachable_model :find_by => [:email, :username] # This will cache id lookups and lookups by columns email and username
end
